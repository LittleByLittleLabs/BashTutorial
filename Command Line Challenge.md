Suppose you are at Netflix and your next task is to combine 3 files into 1, sorted alphabetically using your command line skills. Here are the three files which contain user ratings *user_ratings_ca*, *user_ratings_nv*, *user_ratings_tx*. You will often need to create your own input data as you would here. Your input data should look like the following:
```
