Startup Growth Engineering
----------
About six months ago, I finished reading [Traction](http://tractionbook.com/) written by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares of Duck Duck Go search engine. I've had an opportunity to put some of the following principles below to action @Burner.

When we think about Startup Traction, it's best to define what a startup is. Paul Graham described it best...

> “A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded
> does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a
> startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some
> sort of ‘exit.’ The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we
> associate with startups follows from **growth**.”

To emphasize, the key factor which separates startup from others is the potential for growth. 

This naturallly leads us to Traction aka Growth. Traction means a company is taking off. This could be any of the following:

 - An increase in monthly revenue
 - In case of a mobile app, the number of app downloads
 - In case of a consumer app, Daily or Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)

    In summary, your #1 job at a startup is to find the single best distribution channel.

**Product Trap:** 

As you build your product, startups often find themselves in one of the following scenarios:

 1. No Market: You've built a product but you can't find users to use it.
 2. Small Market: You've built a product but no one besides your initial early adopters is using it.
 3. Hard to reach Market: You've built a product but it's too costly to advertise and get users.
 4. Competitive market: You've built a and found a product market fit. So much so that you're competition has found out about it and decided to compete with you in this distribution channel.

So what is the solution?
This is best described when a startup spends most of their time just building product. A more practical approach would be to:

	Spend 50% of the time building product & 50% of the time in parallel  trying to find a distribution channel which can yield traction (aka Growth)                                                                                                                                                      

Traction goes on to list the 19 distribution channels which can be used using the Bullseye Framework.
